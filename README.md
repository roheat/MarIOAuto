# MarIOAuto
Training an artificial neural network to play a 2D platformer game


The information for the Genetic Algorithm:

This Algorithm was developed from the ground up by Austin Auger and Michael Tillett.
The goal was to use a genetic algorithm to complete a level of Super Mario Bros. 
The project uses methods for crossover, selection, and mutation.
The algorithm is detailed in the commenting of the code.
This is a fun and very engaging project that led to a much deeper understanding of learning as a whole. 

Things you will need:

For Super Mario Bros.
1. FCEUX Emulator - http://www.fceux.com/web/download.html
2. A ROM of Super Mario Bros. (Japan, USA) (can be found in nes folder)
3. Put the copy of the .fcs file (fcs/) in the fcs folder of the emulator(fceux-2.2.3-win32/fcs/)
3. The code stored in the GA folder.

Put the code into a folder (GA/), start up a new game and once the level starts, run the main script through FCEUX.
You can speed up the Emulation using the Turbo function in FCEUX.
Level 1-1 is completed in about 10 generations (might vary from machine to machine) and the resulting AI can beat the game.
